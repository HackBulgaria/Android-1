#### Animated Puzzle

###### Description
Build up on [Puzzle](https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Android-1/tree/master/week1/0-PuzzleGame)
The only difference now is that when the user drops a piece, two animations should play simultaneously, each piece coming onto its new place.
That's it.

###### Hints 
- Use a `GridLayout` instead of multiple `LinearLayout`s.
- Don't swap the drawables this time, simply animate the `ImageView`s
- You must do some extra bookkeeping to be able to check if the puzzle is solved
