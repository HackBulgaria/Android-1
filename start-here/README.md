#### We will be using a Java 8 Oracle VM

While we will not code Android on Java 8 (unfortutanely we need to do a lot of work to do that and won't even gain the performance benefits), we will use the Java 8 VM (the one from Oracle), as it has some serious performance benefits.

You can use either Eclipse + ADT, or the Android Studio based on IntelliJ, but make sure that your IDE is powered by an Oracle Java 8 VM. While not mandatory, we recommend you do that.


#### You may use either Android Studio or Eclipse
Eclipse + ADT is currently the official combination, but Android Studio will be replacing Eclipse in near future (matter of months to a year). Despite being in Beta, we feel Android Studio is good enough for the tasks in hand, and recommend using the Studio. 

If Eclipse is your IDE, it's okay to use Eclipse + ADT as well.
