This is really out of the scope of today's session, but some of you may find it interesting.

Write an application that:
- When entered turns the camera flash `on`
- When exited turns the camera flash `off`

Hints:
- Use the `Camera` API - See http://www.mkyong.com/android/how-to-turn-onoff-camera-ledflashlight-in-android/
