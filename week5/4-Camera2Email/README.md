You are on exam. And it is just starting. Everybody is still shuffling, people are still talking, footstep sounds everywhere.  

You roommate is outside the hall, he doesn't know a thing.  
He needs to receive the test, google a few answers first and then get in the exam hall and appologize for being late.  
You need to help him. 

Go back in time and create an Android application that:
- When launched, goes **directly** in *Camera* application.
- When a photo is taken, it goes **directly** to *email* application and adds the image as attachment. Email, text, and subject must be **preset**.
- A photo must be taken and send to an email with **no more than 3 user interactions**
- Bonus: **No more than 2 user interaction :)** - use Java Mail API - javax.mail 
 
Hints:
- See this Android training: http://developer.android.com/training/camera/index.html
