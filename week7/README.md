Questions to think about: 
- How ugly is the database API in Android from 1 to 10? 
- Why have Google picked SQLite as a database in Android?
- How much "safer" do you feel from SQL injections, now that you've witnessed some examples of the DB layer?
- Why do you think so many years later on and we still don't have a nice [Fluent Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) in Android?
- Explain the difference between PHP's `mysql_query(...random_string...)` approach and  `db.execQuery(...randomString...)` in Android
