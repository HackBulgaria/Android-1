Using the acceleration sensor, detect when the user has applied more force than `CONST`.
Whenever this happens, play a sound - `ray_gun.mp3` or one of your choosing

Note: `CONST` might be different for every device.

Using the proximity sensor, make the phone play something scary when something is very close to the phone - for instance... the user's ear :)
